## ‚ú® Introduction

Prompt Builder is an advanced tool designed for AI art enthusiasts, developers, and prompt engineers. It bridges the gap between a simple idea and a high-quality, perfectly formatted prompt, saving you time and maximizing the potential of generative AI models. The application intelligently manages complex syntax, model-specific parameters, and content rules, allowing you to focus on creativity.

## üöÄ Key Features

*   **üß† Intelligent Prompt Generation:** Utilizes a powerful LLM (via your API key) to expand simple descriptions into multiple detailed prompt variations.
*   **ü§ñ Model-Specific Optimization:** Automatically formats prompts for a wide range of popular AI models, including tag-based (Stable Diffusion), natural language (Google Imagen), MidJourney, and video models.
*   **üîß Advanced Controls:** Fine-tune every aspect with settings for negative prompts, aspect ratios, seeds, and custom parameters.
*   **üé® High-Level Directives:** Use intuitive controls for Style (Realistic/Anime), Character attributes (age, gender, ethnicity, etc.), and Content Rules (SFW/NSFW).
*   **‚ö°Ô∏è Workflow Accelerators:**
    *   **Presets:** Quickly add popular terms for shots, poses, locations, and clothing.
    *   **Snippets:** Save and reuse your favorite phrases or complex character descriptions.
    *   **Enhance & Randomize:** Use AI to enrich your existing idea or generate a new one from scratch based on your settings.
*   **‚öñÔ∏è Prompt Weighting:** Easily increase `(word:1.1)` or decrease `[word]` the importance of selected text.
*   **üñºÔ∏è Integrated Image Generation:** Send a finished prompt directly to the built-in image generator (supports Google Imagen).
*   **üîê Secure & Private:** Your API keys are stored exclusively in your browser's local storage and are never sent to any server.
*   **üíæ Import/Export:** Save your entire workspace setup to a JSON file for backup or to share with others.

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need an API key from a supported Language Model (LLM) provider. This application uses an LLM to understand your intent and generate the structured prompts. Google Gemini (`gemini-2.5-flash`) is recommended.

### Usage

1.  **Open the App:** Navigate to the live demo URL.
2.  **Set Your API Key:**
    *   Expand the **API Settings** section.
    *   Select your LLM provider (e.g., Google Gemini).
    *   Paste your API key into the input field. The app is now ready to use.
3.  **Describe Your Idea:** Type a basic concept into the main text box (e.g., "a knight in a forest").
4.  **Choose Your Target Model:** Select the image/video generation AI model you will be using (e.g., `SDXL`, `Google Imagen4`).
5.  **Generate:** Click the **Generate Prompt** button and see the results!
